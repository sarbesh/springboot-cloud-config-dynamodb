### Security Best Practices

When using Spring Cloud Config DynamoDB, follow these security best practices:

#### AWS Credentials

- **Never hardcode** AWS access keys or secret keys in your code
- Use **IAM roles** for EC2/ECS/Lambda deployments when possible
- Use **environment variables** or **AWS credentials file** for local development
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Apply the **principle of least privilege** for DynamoDB permissions

#### DynamoDB Security

- **Restrict access** to your DynamoDB table using IAM policies
- **Enable encryption** at rest and in transit
- **Use VPC endpoints** for private network access
- **Monitor access** using CloudTrail and CloudWatch
- **Implement backup strategies** for configuration data

#### Application Security

- **Encrypt sensitive configuration** values before storing in DynamoDB
- **Validate input** when processing configuration data
- **Use HTTPS** for all Spring Cloud Config Server endpoints
- **Enable authentication** and authorization for Config Server access
- **Keep dependencies updated** to patch known vulnerabilities

#### Network Security

- **Use private subnets** for your DynamoDB table when possible
- **Implement network ACLs** and security groups appropriately
- **Consider using AWS PrivateLink** for secure connections

#### Configuration Security

```yaml
# Example secure configuration
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        dynamodb:
          # Never commit real credentials
          access-key: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY:}
          secret-key: ${AWS_SECRET_KEY:}
          region: ${AWS_REGION:us-east-1}
          table: ${DYNAMODB_TABLE:config-table}
        # Enable security for Config Server
        security:
          user:
            name: ${CONFIG_USER:admin}
            password: ${CONFIG_PASSWORD:}
```
